# The Kent Theme

## Setup

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies, run grunt and start a watch task.

*Note: we're using the Ruby version of Sass so you'll need to have it in your PATH first - use `gem install sass`*

To restart the watch for any reason simply run `grunt`.

Make a copy of `lib/config.sample.php` and rename to `lib/config.php` - change the WEBROOT if you need to when developing locally.

## Documentation
