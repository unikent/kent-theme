		<h2>Grid</h2>
		<p>The website uses a responsive grid based on <a href="http//:www.bootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a>. Typically content expands from mobile from one column to two columns to four columns.</p>
		<p>Some <a href="/featured_content/feature_panels.html">featured content</a> will span the full width of the page, whereas other elements, such as body text and <a href="/featured_content/feature_layouts.html">feature layouts</a>, are contained within a maximum width.<p/>


		<h2>Page structure</h2>
		<p>Every page on the website uses these global elements to create its basic structure.</p>
		<h3>Kent bar (audience links)    </h3>
		<p>The Kent bar is horizontal bar at the top of each page which provides links to priority audiences. </p>
		<p>The Kent bar also acts as a light branding element on internal content. Once logged in, users will have personalised content accessible from the Kent bar. </p>
		<h3>Global navigation  </h3>
		<p>This comprises of the three main links at the top of the page - Research, Study and Explore, which expose the key user journeys. </p>
		<p>By simplifying options, it makes the site easier for prospects to get to the most important information that they need. </p>
		<h4>Heading 4</h4>
		<p> Fusce a velit eros. Mauris ut mollis nisi. Nam ullamcorper nunc sodales dui dapibus feugiat. Nam tristique elementum massa, quis facilisis nibh.</p>
		<h3>Global search </h3>
		<p>This is the gold search button to the right of the global navigation links. Global search provides categorised results which autocomplete upon typing. </p>
		<p>It will be context aware, so if search in a school site, that schools results will be prioritised. It will always have course results integrated into the search. </p>
		<h3>Global footer  </h3>
		<p>The footer contains additional links which are important, but shouldn't get in the way of the key user journeys in the global nav. Some of the links are duplicated in the footer. </p>
		<p>It also includes Open Days, Social media, Giving to Kent sections and affiliate logos. At the very bottom of the page are subsidiary links.</p>
		<h3>Screen reader skip links </h3>
		<p>These are invisible links which assist screen reader users to navigate the content more easily without having to trawl through repetitive layers of navigation. They allow a user to:    </p>
		<ul>
		  <li> skip to content,    </li>
		  <li>skip to site navigation,     </li>
		  <li>skip to section navigation,    </li>
		  <li>skip to footer. <br />
		  </li>
		</ul>
