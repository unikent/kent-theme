<p>Basing your form design on a customer's perspective is the way to make forms clearer and easier to use. A user should not be forced to adapt to a business process. Good form designs, and therefore higher conversion rates, come from testing with and understanding the context of your users.</p> 

<p>There is no silver bullet for form design, it depends on what you are trying to achieve based on business goals, user needs and context.</p>


<h2>Principles</h2>


<ul>
<li>Reduce the inconvenience - keep forms as simple and easy-to-use as possible. Get rid of visual clutter.</li>
<li>Show the path to completion - make the steps to accomplishing the goal clear</li>
<li>Consider the context - what is the form being used for? How will it be used? Who is using it? Will they be using a mobile? An application form will differ from a marketing email form</li>
<li>Keep form communication consistent - think of a form as a conversation that your customer has with your brand.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Logical groupings</h2>

<p>Split up longer forms into logical groups to help with scanning using a minimal visual information to distinguish the group, such as a subtle background colour.</p>


<h2>Label alignment</h2>

<p>There are advantages and disadvantages to both top-aligning and left-aligning form labels. In <a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2006/07/label-placement-in-forms.php">most instances top-aligned labels tend to reduce form completion times</a>.</p>

<p> The tradeoff is that they take up more vertical space. Sometimes you want to slow users down when filling in an important form. In these instances a left-aligned label may be better.</p>
